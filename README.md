##Getting started:
You will need to set up a db connection, to do that you have to edit config/connection.js and config/models.js.<br>
I've also included a booker.sql with sample data included in, cause there is not api to create items, just orders for them.<br>
After you lift the app and you have some data in items you can go to :8080/#/items/itemId and book your travel.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/AlexN93/booker.git
$ npn install
$ bower install
$ sails lift
```
